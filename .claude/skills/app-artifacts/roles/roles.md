# Role Artifacts

> Part of the [`app-artifacts`](../SKILL.md) skill. Read this before creating a role.

Roles define distinct user personas. **Most apps have zero roles** — all users share one experience.

## When to create roles (critical)

- **ONE role = NO roles.** Do not create a single role artifact; that adds complexity with no benefit.
- **Only create roles when the app serves 2+ DIFFERENT personas with DIFFERENT experiences** — e.g. marketplace needs **Buyer AND Seller**, hiring needs **HR AND Interviewer**, not just one side of the story.
- Each role should have **distinct workflows, navigation, and features** appropriate to that persona. Reuse components where sensible, but the journeys must feel meaningfully different.

### Portals & scoped apps (exception — always 2 roles)

If each user only sees content tied to their own entity (client portal, tenant dashboard, patient portal), this needs a **linkage table** (e.g. `ClientUsers` mapping users↔entities) and inherently means **two roles**: **Admin** (the app owner who manages entities and links users) + the **end-user**. Create both even if the user only described the end-user side. Include an **Admin management page** to add/edit entities and link users (never require manual DB edits). The layout branches by role: Admin → admin nav; end-user with a linkage → scoped experience; end-user without a linkage → **"access pending"** (never a dead-end). Remember roles come from `UsersEntity.role` — never store roles in app tables.

## File location

`artifacts/roles/<Name>.json` — e.g. `Admin.json`, `Editor.json`.

## JSON schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["name", "description"],
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string", "description": "Role name" },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Role description — who this persona is and what they can do"
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

- Role artifacts are synced to blocks: each new role (matched by name) is created. Roles are **create-only** — they cannot be edited or deleted via artifacts, and re-syncing an existing role name is a no-op. For role-aware UI behavior, the frontend uses the `roles-and-authentication` skill and the platform's user role (`UsersEntity.role`).
